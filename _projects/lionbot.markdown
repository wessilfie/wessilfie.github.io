While working on [The Lion]({{site.url}}/projects/thelion), I had the chance to work with our technology team to build LionBot, the easiest way to get questions answered about life at Columbia. Started as a hackathon project, we built out a Messenger bot that students and staff could text 24/7 to get dining hall menus, mental health resources, class schedules, and even ideas for places/restaurants to visit off-campus.

After winning an award for the project during [DevFest](https://devfe.st/), we scaled the bot to hundreds of active users and continued to iterate on new functionality for the bot.

While I no longer work on the project, it has been taken over by [ADI Labs](https://adicu.com/labs/), a student group that works on building products for the Columbia community.
