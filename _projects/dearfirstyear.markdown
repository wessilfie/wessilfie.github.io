Dear First Year is a series of letters and other content written by college upperclassmen and alumni to their first year selves. This project is intended to help incoming college students looking to understand how to make the best of their time in college as well as get some advice from people that were in their shoes not too long ago. Anyone who meets the submitter requirements is welcome to submit to be part of this project.
