I built Buy Black to discover Black-owned businesses throughout the San Francisco Bay Area. 
The current version of the app focuses on restaurants but will be expanded to other business types in the future.

I built this app using [Glide](https://www.glideapps.com/), a new startup I found that allows you to create apps using just a Google sheet.
