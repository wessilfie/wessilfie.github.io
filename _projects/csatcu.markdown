For six semesters, I was a Teaching Assistant for [Professor Paul Blaer üçç](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~pblaer/) for his Introduction to Java and Data Structures courses. I led office hours, taugh recitations, and triaging class needs. 

I was awarded the Andrew P. Kosoresow Memorial Award for Outstanding Performance in TA-ing and Service for my teaching work with the Computer Science department.
