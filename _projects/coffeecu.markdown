Coffee@CU is a site meant to help Columbia students connect with one another over coffee (or tea)!
It was started by fellow Columbia grad [Parthi Loganathan](https://parthi.io/) in 2016 and I helped relaunch the site during my senior year. 
During my time running the site, we helped hundreds of students connect with others outside their immediate communities. 

While I no longer work on the project, it has been taken over by [ADI Labs](https://adicu.com/labs/), a student group that works on building products for the Columbia community.
