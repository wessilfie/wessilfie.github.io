I"<p>As I enter my second year of living in the San Francisco Bay Area, Iâ€™ve been wanting to visit more restaurants. As I researched which restaurants I wanted to focus on in 2020, someone in a group chat recommended exploring some of the Black-owned restaurants in the area. With an idea in mind, I decided to try and build an app to help me identify and track restaurant visits.</p>
