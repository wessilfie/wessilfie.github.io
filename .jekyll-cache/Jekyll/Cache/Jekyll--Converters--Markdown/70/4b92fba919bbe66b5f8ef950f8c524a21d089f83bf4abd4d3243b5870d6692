<p>Coffee@CU is a site meant to help Columbia students connect with one another over coffee (or tea)!
It was started by fellow Columbia grad <a href="https://parthi.io/">Parthi Loganathan</a> in 2016 and I helped relaunch the site during my senior year. 
During my time running the site, we helped hundreds of students connect with others outside their immediate communities.</p>

<p>While I no longer work on the project, it has been taken over by <a href="https://adicu.com/labs/">ADI Labs</a>, a student group that works on building products for the Columbia community.</p>
