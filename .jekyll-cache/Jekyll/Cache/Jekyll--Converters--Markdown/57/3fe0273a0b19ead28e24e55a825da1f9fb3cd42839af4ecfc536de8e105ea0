<p>While working on <a href="https://www.essilfie.com/projects/thelion">The Lion</a>, I had the chance to work with our technology team to build LionBot, the easiest way to get questions answered about life at Columbia. Started as a hackathon project, we built out a Messenger bot that students and staff could text 24/7 to get dining hall menus, mental health resources, class schedules, and even ideas for places/restaurants to visit off-campus.</p>

<p>After winning an award for the project during <a href="https://devfe.st/">DevFest</a>, we scaled the bot to hundreds of active users and continued to iterate on new functionality for the bot.</p>

<p>While I no longer work on the project, it has been taken over by <a href="https://adicu.com/labs/">ADI Labs</a>, a student group that works on building products for the Columbia community.</p>
