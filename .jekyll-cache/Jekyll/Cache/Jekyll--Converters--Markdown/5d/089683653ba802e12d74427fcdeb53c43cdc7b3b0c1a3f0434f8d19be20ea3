<p>I built Buy Black to discover Black-owned businesses throughout the San Francisco Bay Area. 
The current version of the app focuses on restaurants but will be expanded to other business types in the future.</p>

<p>I built this app using <a href="https://www.glideapps.com/">Glide</a>, a new startup I found that allows you to create apps using just a Google sheet.</p>
