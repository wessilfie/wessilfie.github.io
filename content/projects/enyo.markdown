Enyo is an app that lets you upload your iPhone wallpaper and your LinkedIn URL, then generates a new wallpaper with a QR code to your profile. If you're heading to a networking event, people can scan your lock screen and connect in seconds.

With the launch of the new Gemini 3.0 models, I decided to put them to the test by building a new application with just prose—no code. I built the first version entirely in Google's AI Studio, then modified the generated code so it could run smoothly on Vercel.

It's incredible how fast AI-powered tools are advancing and enabling more people to prototype and ship ideas faster.
